<p>In the following lesson youll see me visit URLs of <code>localhost:3000</code> in the address bar to view my website. You can ignore that part of my URL, I want you to continue to use the same local domain youve been using throughout the course, most likely, <code>fictional-university.local</code></p><p>For example in the following lesson when you see me visit this URL:<br><code>localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts</code></p><p>You would visit:<br><code>fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts</code></p><p>This is also true of the JavaScript code we write. When we include a URL in our JS code you can actually remove the base part of your domain entirely, and just begin the URL with a slash character, like this:</p><p><code>$.getJSON("/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?search</code></p><p>If your code isnt working I always recommend downloading the zip resource for the lesson and comparing your code with mine. Ive updated all zip files in the course as of July 2021.</p>
